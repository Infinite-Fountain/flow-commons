in the future, the blueprint will need to be connected to this following project (as a sepparate module or sdk), but make sure the blueprint is ready for this or announce the modification we would need to this project if we keep the blueprint as it is.

A simple, social way to discover impactful public good projects with multi-hashtag “impact hubs,” and let anyone earn USDC rewards for sourcing, vetting, and curating high-signal opportunities.

Impact Hubs are like subreddits, but defined by 3–7 tags (e.g., #open-source #civic-tech #environment #education #latam).
 Start typing tags → the app shows hubs that match; add tags to narrow the thesis.

 Contribute & earn a share
 Submit public good projects, curate project lists, help diligence, or make connections.
 When your work is accepted (allowlisted scouts + peer review), you receive either usdc and attestation points for that hub.

 ## Funders allocate budgets
 Grantors, DAOs, philanthropies, or community pools deposit USDC to support discovery in that hub.
 The hub distributes USDC to eligible contributors each payout cycle, pro-rata to EAS attestation shares.

 Eligibility timing: Newly accepted contributions become eligible starting in the next payout cycle — discourages rush gaming.


No spam: Only allowlisted scouts can mint new submissions; the community peer-reviews projects.


Transparent: Live hub pages show budgets, payout history, recipients, and exportable CSV/JSON.
 

## What counts as impact evidence
- Links to accepted submissions (e.g., PRs, issues, merge commits)
- Deployed artifacts, live demos, or integrations in production
- Usage or impact metrics with a brief methodology
- Community endorsements or attestations from credible stakeholders
- Documentation, tutorials, translations, or localization work
- Datasets published or materially improved, with provenance
- Partnerships or introductions that led to measurable public benefit
- Before/after results with a short writeup or audit trail

## The problem
Most token-for-projects experiments become speculative. Scouts don’t want liability for market swings; funders want rewards tied to real public goods discovery and stewardship, not hype.
The solution
ImpactHubs makes public good discovery social (multi-tag impact hubs) and makes funding intent-aligned and simple:

## What’s novel
Multi-hashtag impact hubs → thesis-aligned micro-communities form fast; discovery is simple.


Non-transferable EAS points → contribution-first incentives; no speculation.


Live payouts & analytics → clear visibility into budgets and distributions; chain-agnostic and contributor-focused.


Open analytics → onchain transparency anyone can verify.
