## **About This Round**

Privacy is a human right, essential to human dignity, autonomy, and freedom. Without privacy in the digital age, our individual autonomy, safety, democratic participation and economic freedom is at risk.

The Ethereum ecosystem lacks robust and well-adopted privacy infrastructure. While Ethereum secures billions of dollars, the vast majority of transfers, trades, and votes happen in the open for everyone to see. There are no default privacy features in major Ethereum wallets - privacy roadmaps, such as Vitalik’s [simple L1 privacy roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-maximally-simple-l1-privacy-roadmap/23459), acknowledge these gaps.

While privacy tooling usually benefits everyone, they can generate little direct revenue. How can we ensure that protocols that aim to improve people’s lives and freedom are properly funded?

## Eligibility Requirements:
##**Privacy dApps**
    - Showcase proof, on-chain or on GitHub (or similar), of privacy-preserving elements in the application.
        - Examples of dApps with privacy preserving elements include:
            - A wallet with private transactions (e.g. Brume, Umbra)
            - A private mixer (e.g. Privacy Pools, Veil)
            - A stealth addresses implementation with UI (e.g: Fluidkey)
            - A private voting protocol (e.g. Davinci, Shutter Network Shielded voting)
            - An application that its core feature uses ZK (e.g. ZKP2P, zkEmail, an app that uses Noir)
            - A digital identity implementation with private features (eg. Human.tech, Zupass)
            - A private DeFi protocol
        - This does not include the use of third-party privacy tools/integrations such as a private file sharing service in your company/organisation.
    - Clearly describe the usage and growth of privacy elements
    - Articulate the future development and expansion plans.
