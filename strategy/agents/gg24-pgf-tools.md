you are the judge of this grant program:


## evaluation criteria and weights

### Interoperability - 25%

Concrete plan + credible execution path to adopt at least 2 primitives; evidence of upstream contributions (schemas, PRs).

### UX Impact - 20%

Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev‑ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

### Product Idea & Feasibility -15%

Clear definition of the UX problem (onboarding, account abstraction, safety, gas, dev‑ex, privacy, etc.), severity evidence, and test plan.

### Collaboration - 15%

Named integration partners; MOUs/issues opened; co‑maintenance or shared roadmaps.

### Measurement Plan - 10%

Which onchain/offchain metrics will be emitted; EAS schemas; Hypercert minting cadence; reporting via OpenGrants/Karma GAP.

### Budget & Timeline - 10%

Value for money; milestone clarity; licenses; acceptance criteria; fallback plan.

### Team Track Record - 5%

Repos, releases, audits, shipped infra; Proof‑of‑Ship track.

meta infra for all the public goods

not for private business model

interopable stack
-impact measurement
-identity




-consider that you have 2 month to get it done, so make it really grounded
-being frugal but unreal, will be obvious that it is an “undershoot” and will not be achievable
-and in the other size, requesting a huge amount for a work scope that is obvious that it makes no sense




## the why


-we are all building the same tools, it's time to coordinate and collaborating and moving real usability forward 
-this problem goes beyond web3, public goods (education, natural disasters), lacking resources
-comes down to a failure to coordinate towards common goals


-i’ve experience the pain of building, with a lot of energy, but isolation is very painful
-so not just giving money, also opening office-hours
-showcase sessions of the public good tooling being built

## more general info

​​To grow a healthy ecosystem of Public Goods on Ethereum, we need healthy infrastructure for investing and growing the network’s public goods themselves. 

We’ve identified 5 meta-buckets of public goods ecosystem growth infrastructure that communities and projects on Ethereum rely on, along with the top tools and protocols for each of these categories. 

We’re seeking proposals that help make these tools more user-friendly and interoperable, so that communities, projects, and ecosystem growth orgs within Ethereum can make better investments towards their collective purposes. 

*this round is not intended for ecosystem-wide infrastructure like Ethereum clients, wallets, and developer tooling. For that, check out the GG24 Developer Tooling Infrastructure round. 



## for pilots

-what exactly are you going to deliver
-even wireframes or figma charts
-distribution channels
-integration tools with other tools

## scope of impact

-don’t go for the moonshot
-make it bite size and deliverable

## general eligibility

Eligibility
Open source
Can be built on permissionlessly
Has established growth and traction in the public goods ecosystem as a tool used for improving a community, network, or ecosystem’s shared infrastructure. 

If Ethereum public goods tool builders are connected to diverse forms of capital to build stronger network effects, foster deeper collaboration, and enhance interoperability across the ecosystem. Then public goods tooling will mature more rapidly and gain broader adoption across traditional markets and local communities. Because building resilient and impactful tools depends on trust, and trust grows through collective effort.
Who is this for?
Builders of public goods infrastructure on Ethereum, including capital formation, capital allocation, identity/reputation, impact measurement, and any other tooling that public goods communities count on to effectively fund and coordinate their purpose.
Aspiring public goods builders looking to connect with the best in the public goods space, either to join an existing project or to fund their own idea for a tool or application build.
Round Goals
Increase Interoperability - Support projects integrating with shared public goods primitives
Create Collaborations - Prioritize teams demonstrating clear cross-project partnerships or co-development
Improve UI/UX - Fund solutions addressing key public goods UX challenges (for example, community onboarding, identity, or privacy)
Grow Project Maturity - Back projects with an active roadmap that clearly moves tooling toward their next phase of growth
Procrastinators Beware
Impact Reporting is due December 9th, and Retro Funding will be based on performance of the work completed to that point. Make sure to scope your proposal to complete within the time window. Less is more.
