## Purpose

A concise, structured description of the **Infinite Fountain** funding mechanism (formerly an app) for consumption by any **AI agent**—to reason about, assist, or automate parts of the process.

---

## High-Level Summary

* **Goal:** Grow multiple public-good projects through a shared, rotating, mutual-aid mechanism.
* **Form:** A *funding mechanism* with community pools, challenges, and a Wisdom Council.
* **UX:** Web‑2.0 friendly—**all Web‑3.0/on‑chain aspects are fully hidden** from end users.
* **Outcome:** Collective ideation, voting, and coordinated action that channels funds and collaboration toward projects.

---

## Entities & Roles

### Projects (aka "Pools")

* Each project has its own **smart contract–backed community pool** (on‑chain, hidden from users).
* \~Up to **10 members** per project (close collaborators and supporters focused on growing the project).

### Members

* Work only on their **specific project**.
* Receive **rewards** from that project's community pool.

### Wisdom Council

* A cross‑project subset of trusted collaborators selected from all groups.
* **Characteristics:** long‑time collaborators; excellent, responsible, talented, wise; enjoy helping others.
* **Scope:** Work across **all projects**; vote on ideas; guide collective direction.
* **Compensation:** Receive pool rewards **plus** **collaboration vouchers** redeemable for a menu of storytelling/content services.

### Architect (You)

* Designs the mechanism, inspired by **Mycelium Networks**.
* **Interconnects pools "blindly"** (participants don't need to know cross‑links) to gently make everyone help each other.

---

## System Principles

* **Rotatory mutual aid:** Projects receive focused attention **one at a time** while Council supports all.
* **Generosity‑first:** Donations to runner‑up ideas are encouraged; **not a financial instrument**.
* **On‑chain in the background:** Smart contracts secure funds and rules; users experience simple Web‑2.0 flows.

---

## Funding & Rewards

* **Community Pools:** Each project's pool dispenses rewards to its members.
* **Vouchers (Wisdom Council):** Additional **collaboration vouchers** redeemable for storytelling/content services.
* **Dashboard:** Council members see voucher balances in their **profile dashboard**.

---

## Challenge Workflow (Recurring)

### Stage 1 — Ideation

* Users watch a **5‑minute, block‑based presentation** (five × 1‑minute narrated segments, with animated illustrations).
* **Controls:** Next/previous navigation; **transcript available**; audio can be muted.
* Content includes **inspiration from books and documentaries** (a give-back/learning feature).
* After viewing, users interact with an **AI Moderator**:

  * Answer an initial prompt.
  * Receive **6 follow‑up prompts** based on their response.
  * Provide a follow‑up and **edit the final submission**.

### Stage 2 — Voting

* **Wisdom Council** votes on the submitted ideas.
* A **Normalize formula** is applied to determine the **winning ideas**.

### Stage 3 — Results & Generosity

* Results presented to all participants.
* **Runner‑Up Generosity Fountain:** Participants can **donate** to runner‑up ideas to promote generosity.
* Donors receive **raffle tickets** in their dashboards.
* At the end of all challenges, **some tippers receive money back**—

  * **Never net‑positive** overall (to keep generosity central; not an investment product).

  ### Generosity flow chart

  All users can always see a page with all the flows, towards the main pool and between members. 
  * This gives a very visual overview of the generosity. 
  * The report is also customized per user, and shows him (vs the median user) how generous they are, how much they have received in rewards, how many generosi-tips they have received, how much they have given to others, etc... 
  * Also shows the main pool evolution and the impact on sponsors and grants toward replenishing it.

### Iteration Across Challenges

* **Challenge 2+** continue from prior outcomes, evolving artifacts and execution.
* The project **shapes itself collectively** with Council guidance and community input.

## Web‑2.0 Friendly UX (Hidden Web‑3.0)

* **All Web‑3.0 aspects are fully hidden.** Users cannot see or need to know on‑chain details.
* The platform can host **purely Web‑2.0 projects** and participants without friction.
* Strategic value: **invite Web‑2.0 experts** to contribute to Web‑3.0 projects; also **onboard Web‑2.0 projects** to use the platform seamlessly.

---

## Example Projects (Non‑exhaustive)

* **Gardens app:** Allocation mechanism using **conviction voting**.
* **Coconut framework:** Framework for farms to become **on‑chain** and **open source**.
* **Cookie Jar:** App enabling **permissionless micro‑grants** under rules.
* **Solar Foundation:** Operating a **Women's Solar Circle**, giving grants to women in Africa in a rotating manner.
* *(A complete list can be attached in a dedicated section.)*
