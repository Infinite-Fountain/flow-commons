- MANIFEST linking raw → normalized → plan → execution receipts, with code commit hashes
  - Explanation & Benefit: Create a single `MANIFEST.json` per epoch listing all artifacts (paths, SHA-256 file hashes, sizes, timestamps) and the exact Git commit of the code used. This provides end‑to‑end provenance and tamper‑evidence. Reviewers can verify integrity, trace lineage across steps, and confidently reproduce results without ambiguity.
  - Extra integration: Add `MANIFEST.schema.json` (artifacts[type,path,sha256,size,computedAt], code{repo,commit,tags,toolVersions}, params{file,hash}). CI re-hash step fails on mismatch. Attach MANIFEST to a GitHub Release (`category/page@vX.Y`). Optionally PGP-sign and store `manifestCid` (IPFS) alongside the plan.
- Plan integrity: on-chain plan-hash commit + cooldown before execution
  - Explanation & Benefit: Before payouts, the contract stores `keccak256(distribution-plan.json)` with `epochId` and enforces a cooldown timestamp. Execution checks hash equality and time window, otherwise reverts. This creates a binding between published artifacts and on‑chain actions, adds a human review window, and prevents last‑minute tampering or rushed errors.
  - Extra integration: Contract: `commitPlan(epochId, planHash, manifestCid, earliestExecuteAt)`, `executePlan(epochId, planHash)`. Events: `PlanCommitted`, `PlanExecuted`. CLI flow: generate plan → write MANIFEST → commit plan (capture Tenderly sim URL) → wait cooldown → execute → write receipts.
- Public reviewer docs: rubric, parameter file, and simulation evidence
  - Explanation & Benefit: Publish a concise `docs/` bundle per epoch: `rubric.md` (criteria), `params.json` (normalization/allocation settings), and simulation links/screenshots (e.g., Tenderly URLs). Clear, standardized documentation accelerates review, clarifies assumptions, and demonstrates due diligence, improving trust and speeding acceptance by grant reviewers and researchers.
  - Extra integration: Scripted generation of `docs/` per epoch, including `SIMULATION.md` (Tenderly/Foundry traces) and `REPRODUCE.md` (one-liner to run notebook). Add a docs linter (links exist, files non-empty). Cross-link all docs from MANIFEST.



2025-10-16T00:55:00Z | we will wait MACI for later

decision: Wait on MACI integration. This allows validation of core system before adding cryptographic voting complexity.

Question to ai4pg-judge: Is there anything we should add to the blueprint, that is very important to you, and we should not skip in this first iteration? (skip everything that can wait for the next iteration). answer in short bulletpoints.


2025-10-16T00:50:00Z | Agent Responses to MACI Voting Question

**AI4PG Judge**: MACI voting aligns perfectly with AI4PG goals for transparent, verifiable public goods funding decisions. Provides cryptographic privacy while maintaining auditability - exactly what grant reviewers need. Complexity: Medium - well-documented implementation with existing tooling.

**AI Agents Judge**: MACI adds significant complexity to our agent architecture. Need new MACI Coordinator Agent to handle key generation, vote encryption, tallying, and dispute resolution. Integration complexity: High - requires specialized cryptographic knowledge and additional infrastructure. Recommendation: Phase 2 feature after core system is stable.

**Identity Connection Judge**: MACI complements UIR well - users can vote privately while maintaining canonical attribution. Need to map MACI public keys to canonicalUserId for reward distribution. Complexity: Medium - straightforward integration with existing UIR system.

**Hashtag Judge**: MACI prevents vote buying and coercion, essential for authentic community participation. Aligns with hashtag project goals of genuine community engagement. Complexity: Medium - proven technology with good documentation.


**Moderator**: MACI is valuable but adds complexity. Recommend implementing in phases: Phase 1 (current system), Phase 2 (MACI integration). This allows validation of core system before adding cryptographic voting complexity.

Question to all the agents:
Is it a good idea to add MACI voting to our blueprint? how complex would this be?

2025-10-16T00:45:00Z | AI Agents Judge | UIR Agent Assessment
- **Recommendation**: YES, add dedicated UIR Management Agent
- **Rationale**: UIR operations are complex enough to warrant specialized agent - identity resolution, binding management, fallback handling, and cross-provider validation require focused expertise
- **Agent Responsibilities**:
  - Resolve `canonicalUserId` from any provider binding
  - Manage identity binding operations (add/remove/verify)
  - Handle fallback mechanisms when resolution fails
  - Validate provider-specific data formats
  - Maintain UIR data consistency across all agents
- **Integration**: Other agents call UIR Management Agent for identity resolution rather than handling UIR logic themselves
- **Blueprint Addition**: Add UIR Management Agent to Core Execution Agents list

2025-10-16T00:40:00Z | Identity Connection Judge | Response to Concerns

**Clarification**: UIR DOES create a single, stable internal ID (`canonicalUserId`) for each user. The concerns are about implementation details, not the core concept.

**To AI Agents Judge**: UIR includes fallback mechanisms - if `canonicalUserId` cannot be determined, use `displayId` (last-4 of primary binding) as temporary identifier. Data Ingestion Agent should log failed resolutions for manual review.

**To Visual Architect**: Chart mapping is simple - use `canonicalUserId` for all nodes, `displayId` for labels. Multiple `providerBindings` don't create multiple nodes; they're metadata. One user = one node = one `canonicalUserId`.

**Core UIR Design**: Each user gets ONE stable `canonicalUserId` regardless of how many identity providers they link. This prevents duplicate rewards and ensures consistent attribution across all systems.

2025-10-16T00:35:00Z | Agent Review of UIR Proposal

**AI4PG Judge**: No concerns. 

**AI Agents Judge**: Minor concern

**Hashtag Judge**: No concerns.

**Visual Architect**: Concern - UIR schema needs clear mapping to chart nodes. How do we handle users with multiple providerBindings in USDC/EAS flow charts? Need displayId consistency rules for visual elements.

**Moderator**: No concerns. 

2025-10-16T00:30:00Z | Identity Connection Judge | Single Blueprint Addition
- **Required Addition**: Add Unified Identity Record (UIR) schema to blueprint
- **Specific Edit**: In `../blueprint.md`, add new section:
  ```
  ## Unified Identity Record (UIR)
  - **canonicalUserId**: internal stable id (e.g., `uid:<sha256(providerId|salt)>`)
  - **displayId**: UI-friendly last-4 (privacy), derived from canonical or primary binding
  - **providerBindings**: object keyed by provider type with normalized identifiers
    - `privy`: `{ did: string, privyId: string }` (strip `did:privy:` for storage)
    - `wallet`: array of `{ chainId: number, address: string (EIP-55) }`
    - `privySmartWallet`: array of `{ chainId, address }`
    - `humanPassport`: `{ subjectId: string, credentialRef?: string }`
    - `worldId`: `{ nullifierHash: string, credentialRef?: string }`
  - **preferredPayoutWallet?**: `{ chainId: number, address: string (EIP-55) }`
  - **evidence**: array of references (EAS UIDs, credential hashes/URLs)
  - **createdAt**, **updatedAt**, **version**
  ```
- **Rationale**: Without UIR, users cannot link multiple identity providers (Privy, wallets, World ID) to single canonical user, causing attribution issues and duplicate rewards


2025-10-16T00:25:00Z | AI Agents Judge | Proposal Implemented ✅
- **Status**: SOLVED - Agent Architecture section added to blueprint
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive 11-agent architecture with event-driven communication, retry policies, and audit trails
- **Result**: Blueprint now has systematic agent design instead of monolithic AI approach

2025-10-16T00:20:00Z | AI Agents Judge | Response to Fraud Detection Proposal
- **Overall Architecture Score**: 7/10 - Good foundation but needs systematic agent architecture
- **Fraud Detection Assessment**: Excellent addition! Aligns perfectly with our Fraud Detection Agent design. The proposed rules (self-scoring exclusions, outlier detection, collusion checks) match our core execution agents specification.
- **Critical Gap**: Blueprint lacks systematic agent architecture. Current design treats AI as monolithic rather than specialized agents with clear responsibilities.
- **Blueprint Proposal**: Add "Agent Architecture" section defining 11 specialized agents: Data Ingestion → Fraud Detection → Normalization → Allocation → Blockchain Execution → Attestation → Plan Integrity → Multi-sig Coordination → Audit → Notification → Dashboard Update. Each agent has single responsibility, event-driven communication, retry policies, and audit trails. This modular approach ensures reliability, scalability, and maintainability for production deployment handling real money.


2025-10-16T00:15:00Z | AI4PG Judge | Single Blueprint Tweak
- **Required Addition**: Add fraud detection section to blueprint
- **Specific Edit**: In `../blueprint.md`, add new section:
  ```
  ## Fraud Detection & Anomaly Handling
  - Self-scoring exclusions: flag and exclude votes where reviewer = submitter
  - Outlier detection: flag scores >2 standard deviations from reviewer's mean
  - Collusion checks: detect suspicious voting patterns (identical scores across multiple reviewers)
  - All exclusions logged with rationale in `fraud-detection.json` artifact
  - Excluded votes removed before normalization; original data preserved for audit
  ```
- **Rationale**: Without fraud detection, allocation pipeline lacks credibility for grant reviewers


2025-10-16T00:00:00Z | Moderator | Kickoff
- Topic: Start review cycle; AI4PG alignment and visualization readiness
- Questions to AI4PG Judge:
  1) Using only the original AI4PG goals, what are the top 3 gaps you expect to see in our current plan for decision-making improvements (allocation, evaluation, governance)?
  2) Which AI/ML application areas from the list (allocation/matching, impact prediction, proposal scoring, fraud detection, governance tools, preference aggregation, mechanism design) should we prioritize to maximize pathway-to-impact in the next 4 weeks?
  3) What evidence would most persuade reviewers that our approach is reproducible and transparent?
